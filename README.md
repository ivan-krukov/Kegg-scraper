WARNING - LOW QUALITY CODE
======
You have been warned.
This is a rather simplistic web-page scraper for KEGG.
It attempts to retrieve information from KEGG and then puts it in an SQLite database.
Currently supported queries are EC numbers and KEGG reaction IDs.
PS: I am pushing this code as more of a backup solution. Maybe one day I will have the time to clean the code. (Probably not)
